# Getting Started Guide

## What You Need

**Gas Fees:**

* Gas fees are transaction fees required to execute a transaction. These vary by blockchain. For Swan Chain transactions, sETH is required.

**Payment to Computing Providers:**

* In addition to gas fees, you must pay Computing Providers in SWAN Credits to utilize their computing resources to power your Space (Application).

**Collateral (For Computing Providers Only):**

* Fog Computing Providers (FCPs) must deposit a minimum of 0.001 sETH per task as collateral. Ensure you meet this requirement to receive task assignments.

### Fund Your Wallet

**Step 1: Purchasing ETH**

Fund your wallet with ETH from any Decentralized Exchange (DEX) or Centralized Exchange (CEX).&#x20;

Funding your network account is required to use the network. All transactions, including claiming Swan Credit tokens and deploying Spaces, charge a transaction fee. Ensure you have sufficient ETH to cover these costs.

**Step 2: Bridge ETH from Ethereum to Swan Chain**

Go to[ Bridge](https://bridge.swanchain.io/), enter the amount of ETH you wish to bridge, and click on the "Deposit" button.
