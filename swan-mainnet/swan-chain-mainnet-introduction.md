# Swan Chain Mainnet Introduction

Welcome to the Swan Chain Mainnet! Concluding the legacy of our successful "Planet" testnet series — Lagrange Mars, Swan Jupiter, Swan Saturn, and Proxima Tesnets, this new chapter of Swan Chain introduces a new era with enhanced functionalities in AI, Data, and more rewards for computing providers, dApp developers, and AI enthusiasts.

***

## Technical Feature Updates

After completing the entire “Planet” Testnet series, we will launch the mainnet. This is an important step in realizing our vision of becoming a toolset for AI Blockchain. We have updated the mainnet with several new features, including:

### **Bridge**

Swan Chain has launched its native bridge on the network. Here's how it works:

* Deposit: Transfer ETH from Ethereum to sETH on Swan Chain
* Withdraw: Transfer sETH from Swan Chain to ETH on Ethereum.&#x20;

Users can access the Bridge here: bridge.swanchain.io&#x20;

### **Orchestrator**

If you have participated in Swan Chain as a Computing Provider, you may already be familiar with the overview website called Orchestrator. During the mainnet phase, we will introduce several new features, including:

* Detailed CP Information
* A map showing the number of Computing Providers worldwide
* Statistics on the number of active Providers

For more information, users can visit the website: [https://orchestrator.swanchain.io/provider-status](https://orchestrator.swanchain.io/provider-status)&#x20;

### **Faucet**

Users can claim free SWAN Credit Token from the faucet under the following conditions: Each wallet can claim 24 tokens every 24 hours. If your wallet balance exceeds 240 tokens, you won't be able to claim any more tokens. \


Two ways to receive SWAN Credit Token, you can claim them from the faucet or earn them by participating in a computing provider job. Visit the following website to start claiming tokens: [https://faucet.swanchain.io](https://swanscan.io/).\
\
Note: Please note that the test token for the mainnet (SWAN Credit) is not connected to the rewards of the Atom testnet, even though they share the same name (SWAN Credit). The SWAN Credit in this mainnet phase is only used as a test token for deploying space on the mainnet.

### **Explorer**

In the mainnet phase, we will update the UI/UX of the old explorer website to a new, more user-friendly design. The new site will offer faster and more accurate updates, making it easier for users, developers, and computing providers to track Swan Chain's on-chain metric.&#x20;

Here is the new Swan Explorer: [https://mainnet-explorer.swanchain.io](https://mainnet-explorer.swanchain.io) or [https://swanscan.io/ ](https://swanscan.io/)

## Campaign Duration

The campaign spans two full months, **from July 2nd, 23:00 (EST).**&#x20;

***

## **Total Reward Pool**

In this Mainnet Campaign, we won't mention the exact rewards users will receive. However, if you participate and achieve high rankings, the rewards will be substantial!&#x20;

***

## Series of Events in Campaign

1. [**Computing Provider Program**](computing-provider-campaign.md)**:** Boost our computational resources with diverse providers from fog to edge computing.&#x20;
2. **Social Engagement Mission:** Participate in interactive social challenges on [Swan Galxe Campaign](galxe-campaign.md) and [Swan Mainnet Mission](swan-mainnet-mission.md) to earn massive rewards.

### 3. Become the Computing Provider

{% hint style="info" %}
By supporting the Swan network with your computing resources as a Computing Provider, you'll not only help fuel its growth but also be eligible to win a portion of the prize pool offered through the [**CP Acceleration Program**](https://docs.swanchain.io/swan-testnet/atom-accelerator-race/cp-acceleration-program)**.**

### 4. Deploy Lagrange Spaces

{% hint style="info" %}
[**Lagrange**](https://lagrangedao.org/spaces) is one of the most outstanding dApps in the Swan ecosystem. It serves as an all-in-one decentralized computing platform, empowering developers to build web3 apps with a comprehensive suite of Web3 tools.

By using[ **Lagrange**](https://lagrangedao.org/spaces) (specifically by deploying Lagrange spaces), you engage in on-chain transactions on the Swan Chain. This participation helps you qualify for the [**On-chain Interaction Race**](https://docs.swanchain.io/swan-testnet/atom-accelerator-race/on-chain-interaction-race), which offers up to **1.5M credits.**
