# Protocol Stack

Swan Chain is designed as a full toolset AI Blockchain infrastructure, providing comprehensive solutions across storage, computing, bandwidth, and payments. The protocol stack is a multi-layered architecture that ensures efficient and secure operations within the Swan Chain ecosystem. Below is an overview of each layer in the protocol stack:

## Protocol Layers

1. [Consensus Layer](cross-chain-contracts.md)—responsible for smart contract execution and payment settlement.
2. &#x20;[Peer-to-peer (P2P) Network](peer-to-peer-p2p-network.md)—defines how nodes locate and connect.
3. &#x20;[Payment Channels](payment-channels.md) —facilitates fast and low-cost payments in the system.
4. [Service Discovery](service-discovery.md)  – Server nodes and reputation module for public service
5. [Market Provider](market-provider/) - Entity that offers various computing and storage tasks to the network
6. [Storage Layer](storage-layer.md) — data stored on public blockchains or content addressable networks.
7. [Computing Layer ](computing-layer/)— how a query is routed to a specific node for computing.
8. [CDN Layer ](cdn-layer.md)– how data is distributed and hosted on the global network
9. [Governance](token/governance/) —manages schemas, treasure, and disputes.
