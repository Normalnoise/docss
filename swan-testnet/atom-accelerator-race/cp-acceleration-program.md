# CP Acceleration Program

The Computing Provider Acceleration Program is an exciting event designed to attract more computing providers to the Swan Chain network, boosting its overall computing power and capabilities. This program is part of the larger Atom Accelerator Race, which aims to drive ecosystem growth and adoption before the mainnet launch.

### Duration

April 29th , 00:00 (EST) - June 29th, 2024, 23:59 (EST)

### How to Participate

#### As an ECP (Edge Computing Provider)

* Participants will need to deploy a [Computing Provider](https://docs.swanchain.io/orchestrator/as-a-computing-provider/computing-provider-setup) according to the instructions provided and follow this [documentation](https://docs.swanchain.io/orchestrator/as-a-computing-provider/connect-to-orchestrator) to complete ZK tasks. Credits will be earned based on their performance in ZK jobs.
