‚ùì What is the Proxima Testnet?

‚úÖ  The Proxima Testnet is the final testnet before the Swan Chain mainnet launch. The Atom Accelerator Race aims to stress test this network before launch.



‚ùì: What are differences between Atom Accelerator Race campaigns and Saturn Testnet Incentive Programs?

‚úÖ  The Atom Accelerator Race featured a Contribution Credit System, which quantifies and rewards active participation, benefiting top contributors in the ecosystem.

Our incentivized testing campaigns are organized into two major series:

1. The first series, called the "Planet" series, centers around chain and testnet operations. This series operates on a token-based rewarding system. It includes testnets such as the Langrange Mars Testnet, Swan Jupiter Testnet, and Swan Saturn Testnet.
2. The second series, known as the "Atom" series, emphasizes functionality and operates on a credit-based rewarding system. Within this series, the Proton testnet evaluates the file storage capabilities of storage providers, while the Electron testnet focuses on testing multichain storage functionality. Additionally, the upcoming Atom Accelerator Race will further showcase Swan's computing capabilities.



‚ùì: Which wallets are compatible with the Testnet?
