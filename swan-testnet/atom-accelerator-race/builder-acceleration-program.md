# Builder Acceleration Program

The Builder Acceleration Program is an exciting opportunity for developers and builders to contribute to the growth of the Swan Chain ecosystem. This program aims to attract more AI models and Zero-Knowledge (ZK) applications, enriching the network's capabilities and fostering innovation.

### Duration

April 25th , 00:00 (EST) - June 25th, 2024, 23:59 (EST)

### How to Participate

To participate in the Builder Acceleration Program, follow these steps:

1. **Build Lagrange LDL Configs or Dockerfiles**: Participants will be required to build [Lagrange LDL configs](https://docs.lagrangedao.org/spaces/intro/lagrange-definition-language-ldl) (and container images/Dockerfiles if needed) for specific AI models or ZK applications.
2. **Contribute to the Open-Source Repository**: Commit your Lagrange LDL configs or Dockerfiles to the open-source code repository hosted on GitHub [here](https://github.com/swanchain/awesome-swanchain).
3. **Deploy and Run**: participants are required to deploy their Lagrange LDL configs or Dockerfiles in Lagrange, follow this [video tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDHNHbIxDYY) or the [documentation](https://docs.lagrangedao.org/spaces) and ensure they are running correctly.
