### **Mission**

Swan Testnet is on a mission to establish an open and decentralized marketplace for cloud computing resources, leveraging the power of the Optimism Network.&#x20;

By incentivizing global computing providers, Swan aims to broaden access to GPU power for AI/ML projects and dApp deployment. This campaign is an opportunity to showcase Swan's capabilities, gather feedback, and reward providers, marking a significant stride toward realizing an efficient, open marketplace for cloud computing.

### **Goals**

1. Onboard 50 new computing providers to the Swan testnet to expand geographic coverage and computing capacity
2. Achieve over 100 GPUs contributed across computing providers to provide robust AI and dApp infrastructure
3. Enable over $10,000 worth of computing transactions on the testnet for stability testing of multichain payment channels.
4. Support the deployment of at least 500 Spaces on the Swan network
5. Form strategic partnerships with 5 AI/ML projects to demonstrate Swan's ability to power cutting-edge innovation
6. Gather feedback from 30+ Computing Providers to help inform the roadmap and mainnet launch
7. Distribute allocated SWAN rewards to incentivize providers and drive participation
8. Document key learnings, challenges, and successes throughout the testnet launch to aid the transition to mainnet
