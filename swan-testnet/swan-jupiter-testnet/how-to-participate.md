1\. Follow[ Documentation](https://docs.lagrangedao.org/lagrange-dao/computing) to deploy a Computing Provider.

2\. Check the [Dashboard](https://provider.lagrangedao.org/provider-status) to confirm if the Computing Provider is running, and maintain a provider uptime exceeding 90%.

3.Submission of the[ form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeTDXjTGmPB7MuSGJJZMO2Ctk12VAoYU6aTmLeFR0jeW5M-zw/viewform) is required upon task completion.

### Reward Structure

**Reward 1: Universal Basic Income (UBI) Trial Rewards**

Participants with successfully deployed and actively running Computing Providers will receive **600 SWAN (20 SWAN per day)** as part of the [UBI Trial Rewards program](https://docs.filswan.com/getting-started/protocol-stack/economic-system/universal-basic-income-ubi), designed to provide a basic level of compensation to qualified providers.

**Reward 2: Contribution Rewards**

Eligible Computing Providers contribute to the Swan Network and will receive a share of the prize pool of **100,000 SWAN** proportional to their contributions.

Contributions are based on the amount of space deployed, GPU and CPU usage duration, and CP uptime.

**Reward 3: Regional Computing Dao Pilot Program Rewards**

Eligible new computing providers from countries without a representative CP will receive an additional **600 SWAN**.

the U.S., Canada, the Netherlands, Ukraine, Finland, China, Japan, Singapore, Australia, and countries with existing computing providers are excluded from this Reward.

**Reward 4: Referral Rewards**

All eligible CPs who successfully refer new CPs to the Network, and the referred CP is also eligible, will receive a referral reward of **300 SWAN** tokens for each successful referral.

#### Eligibility Criteria

* Run at least one [**UBI task**](../../orchestrator/as-a-computing-provider/fcp-fog-computing-provider/faq.md) during the campaign to confirm a successful setup.
* Maintain provider uptime exceeding **90%**.
* Submission of the [**form**](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeTDXjTGmPB7MuSGJJZMO2Ctk12VAoYU6aTmLeFR0jeW5M-zw/viewform) is required upon task completion.
