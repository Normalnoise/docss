# Computing Provider Program

Get ready to contribute to the [**Swan Chain Saturn Testnet** ](http://saturn-testnet.swanchain.io/)and be rewarded for your valuable resources. The **Computing Provider Program** offers a lucrative opportunity to earn up to **1,000,000 SWAN tokens** by simply sharing your processing power (CPU and GPU), memory, storage, and bandwidth.

## Duration

24th January 2024, 09:00 (EST) - 22nd March 2024, 00:00 (EST)

## **How to Participate**

1. **Deploy a Computing Provider:** Follow the [easy-to-understand documentation](https://docs.swanchain.io/orchestrator/as-a-computing-provider/computing-provider-setup) to get started.
2. **Maintain Uptime:** Keep your provider running smoothly with an uptime exceeding 90%. Monitor your status through [the dashboard](https://orchestrator.swanchain.io/).

## Reward Structure

The program boasts three exciting components, each designed to recognize your contributions:

### **1. UBI Rewards (150,000 SWAN)**

Share a portion of this pool based on your UBI earnings. The more you earn, the bigger your slice! (Think progressive rewards!)

{% hint style="success" %}
**Calculation:**

UBI Rewards = (Your UBI Earnings รท Total UBI Earnings Yield) ร 150,000 (Prize Pool)
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
**Example:**

If you earn 5,000 test SWAN, amounting to 10% of the total UBI earnings, you'll be entitled to 10% of the Saturn Prize Pool, or 15,000 SWAN tokens.
{% endhint %}

### **2. Contribution Rewards (800,000 SWAN)**

Get handsomely compensated for actively contributing resources. The longer your GPUs and CPUs are utilized, and the higher your uptime, the more SWAN you'll rake in!

{% hint style="info" %}
**Extra rewards**

Use high-density GPUs like Nvidia H100s, A100s, or top consumer models to receive a 3-10x reward boost for completed tasks.
