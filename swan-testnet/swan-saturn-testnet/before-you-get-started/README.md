# Before You Get Started

Here's what you'll need before you ge started:

**Gas Fees**:  Gas Fee is a type of transaction fee that you have to pay to execute a transaction. The fees vary based on the blockchain. Swan Saturn Testnet transactions require **SwanETH.**

**Payment to Computing Providers:** In addition to gas fees, you'll need to pay Computing Providers in **SWAN** to exchange their computing resources for powering your Space (Application).

**Collateral (Required for CPs Only)**: CPs are now mandated to deposit a minimum of 50 **SWAN** tokens as collateral into the contract. Failure to meet this requirement will result in the inability to receive task assignments.

Before immersing yourself in the Swan Saturn Testnet Campaign, ensure you make the necessary preparations:

* Set up your Metamask Wallet&#x20;
* Fund your Wallet with SwanETH&#x20;
* Fund your Wallet with Swan test SWAN
