# Edge Computing Provider (ECP)

Edge Computing Providers (ECPs) are integral to the Swan Chain ecosystem, specializing in processing data at the source of data generation with minimal latency. They are essential for real-time applications, handling localized tasks directly on devices at the network's edge, such as IoT devices.

ECPs will be responsible for completing Zero-Knowledge (ZK) tasks, contributing to the network's processing power, and ensuring the integrity and confidentiality of computations.

### **Duration:**&#x20;

July 29, 2024, 00:00 (EST) - Sep 29, 2024, 23:59 (EST)

### ECP Requirements:

* Public IP
* At least one GPU
* Minimum 4 vCPUs
* Minimum 300GB HDD storage
* Minimum 32GB memory
* Minimum 20MB bandwidth

### How to Participate:

1. Deploy an ECP according to the [provided instructions](../../../bulders/computing-provider/edge-computing-provider-ecp/ecp-setup.md) and documentation.
2. Complete ZK tasks to earn credits based on performance.
3. Check the ECP leaderboard here: [https://provider.swanchain.io/campaign/ecp](https://provider.swanchain.io/campaign/ecp)

### Event Rules and Rewards:

1. **Total Reward Pool:** 420,000 SWAN tokens
2. **Reward Distribution:**
   * Performance-based rewards: 398,000 SWAN
   * Early Participant rewards: 22,000 SWAN
3. **Performance-based Rewards (398,000 SWAN):**
   * Rewards will be distributed based on the number of successfully completed ZK tasks and overall contribution to the network.
   * The more time an ECP is online and the more tasks it completes, the higher its reward will be.

{% hint style="info" %}
ECPs can join at any time to be eligible for **Performance-Based Rewards.**
{% endhint %}

4. **Early Participant Rewards (22,000 SWAN):**

Early participants will be rewarded based on a tiered system:

* First 50 ECPs: 100 SWAN each (Total: 5,000 SWAN)
* Next 100 ECPs: 50 SWAN each (Total: 5,000 SWAN)
* Next 200 ECPs: 30 SWAN each (Total: 6,000 SWAN)
* Next 300 ECPs: 20 SWAN each (Total: 6,000 SWAN)

{% hint style="info" %}
To qualify for **Early Participant Rewards**, you must join within the first **3 weeks** of the event, by August 18.
{% endhint %}

5. **Minimum Performance Threshold:**

* ECPs must complete a minimum of 1,000 ZK tasks during the event period, which runs from July 29, 2024, 00:00 (EST) to September 29, 2024, 23:59 (EST).

6. **Reward Cap:**

* To promote fair distribution, a cap of 5,000 SWAN tokens per individual ECP will be implemented.
