### **Reward Structure**

The total prize pool that can be won depends on how many transactions are made. The more transactions, the more tokens are added to the prize pool. The prize pool starts with **100,000 SWAN tokens** and **gets 50,000 more tokens every time 200,000 more transactions** are done.

The winners are the **10,000 wallets** that have the **highest transaction counts.** They will share the prize pool according to the reward tier table.

The rewards from the Transaction Drive Program will be distributed in the form of NFTs. These NFTs can be used to claim SWAN tokens after TGE.

## Stage 2

### **Prize Pool: 720,000 SWAN**

### **Rules and Participation**

To ensure a fair and secure testing environment, we have implemented a new mechanism with enhanced security measures to prevent exploitation and prioritize genuine user engagement. Participants will earn rewards based on their individual efforts across five tasks, each with varying levels of difficulty and corresponding rewards from the **720,000 SWAN** prize pool.

**Prerequisite:** âœ… Verify your wallet address by completing the [GalXe campaign](https://galxe.com/filswan/campaign/GC3wptwc4w). This is a mandatory step to verify your wallet address for participation.

**Tasks and Rewards:**

| Task | Task Name                   | Difficulty Level | Total Rewards (SWAN)    | % of Remaining Prize Pool |
| ---- | --------------------------- | ---------------- | ----------------------- | ------------------------- |
| 1    | Transferring Tokens         | Beginner         | 180,000                 | 25%                       |
| 2    | Bridging Tokens             | Elementary       | 108,000 + 3,600 (Bonus) | 15% + 5% (Bonus)          |
| 3    | Deploying Contracts         | Intermediate     | 108,000                 | 15%                       |
| 4    | Deploying Space on Lagrange | Advanced         | 288,000                 | 40%                       |

**Bonus for Task 2:** There will be a 5% bonus (3,600 SWAN) from the prize pool to reward users who bridge more Sepolia ETH from the Ethereum network to the SWAN chain.

**Rewards Distribution:** Participants will earn rewards based on their contributions to the tasks they choose to participate in. Higher effort and engagement will potentially result in higher rewards. The difficulty level of each task determines the complexity and potential rewards available.

**Eligibility:** To be eligible for rewards, participants must:

1. Complete the GalXe campaign to verify their wallet address (Prerequisite).
2. Participate in one or more of the tasks outlined above.
3. Comply with all rules and guidelines set forth by the SwanChain team.
4. Avoid any form of exploitation, automated activities, or actions that undermine the fairness and integrity of the testing environment.

Genuine participation and meaningful contributions are highly encouraged and will be rewarded accordingly. The SwanChain team reserves the right to disqualify participants suspected of violating the rules or engaging in exploitative behaviors.
