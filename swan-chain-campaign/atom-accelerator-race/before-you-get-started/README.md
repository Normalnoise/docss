# Before You Get Started

Here's what you'll need before you ge started:

**Gas Fees**: Gas Fee is a type of transaction fee that you have to pay to execute a transaction. The fees vary based on the blockchain. Swan Chain transactions require **SwanETH.**

**Payment to Computing Providers:** In addition to gas fees, you'll need to pay Computing Providers in **SWAN** to exchange their computing resources for powering your Space (Application).

**Collateral (Required for CPs Only)**: CPs are now mandated to deposit a minimum of **0.01** **SwanETH** per task as collateral into the contract. Failure to meet this requirement will result in the inability to receive task assignments.
