# Introduction to Swan Chain

[Swan Chain](https://www.swanchain.io) (formerly FilSwan), initiated in 2021, is a full toolset AI blockchain infrastructure designed to accelerate AI adoption. Utilizing OP Stack's Ethereum Layer 2 technology, [Swan Chain](https://www.swanchain.io/) merges Web3 with AI, offering comprehensive solutions across storage, computing, bandwidth, and payments. Through [LagrangeDAO](https://app.gitbook.com/o/-Ma7\_tf6L8A170GHT9fr/s/y5iPODl9iwLxyYirHs2D/), it enables efficient AI model deployment while reducing computing costs by up to 70% and monetizing idle computing resources.

SwanChain's innovative approach introduces a [Universal Basic Income (UBI) ](getting-started/protocol-stack/token/swan-universal-basic-income-ubi/)model for [computing providers](swan-provider/computing-provider-cp/fog-computing-provider-fcp/computing-provider-setup.md) within its ZK market, ensuring stable income and incentivizing continuous contributions.&#x20;

#### Core Objectives and Motivation

* **Decentralized AI Computing Market**: At the heart of Swan Chain's ambition is the creation of a marketplace that empowers AI developers with the necessary computational resources for training and deploying sophisticated AI models on AI platforms like [Lagrange](https://lagrangedao.org). This initiative is designed to fill the void between the high demand for premium computing in AI research and the resources available within the blockchain ecosystem.
* **Support for Web3 Projects**: Swan Chain acknowledges the transformative essence of Web3 technologies, aspiring to lay down a foundational infrastructure that underpins the deployment and functioning of decentralized applications (DApps). This includes a suite of decentralized storage solutions, computing power, and ancillary services, all aimed at propelling the decentralized web's expansion.
* **Innovative Ecosystem Products**: The ecosystem of Swan Chain is augmented with groundbreaking products like[ MultiChain.storage](https://www.multichain.storage) for decentralized data storage, the [Lagrange ](https://lagrangedao.org)platform for decentralized computing, and a Decentralized Task Orchestrator, which collectively streamline the management and distribution of computing tasks across the network.
* **Universal Basic Income (UBI) Model**: A standout feature of Swan Chain is its commitment to fostering a fair and equitable ecosystem via the implementation of a UBI model for computing providers. This innovative approach guarantees compensation for participants' contributions, promoting inclusivity and sustainability within the network.

#### Enhanced Technologies and Infrastructure

Swan Chain incorporates state-of-the-art technologies to materialize its ambitious objectives:

* **Kubernetes and Blockchain Integration**: Utilizing Kubernetes for container orchestration alongside blockchain for securing transactions and automating processes, Swan Chain establishes a highly efficient, scalable, and secure infrastructure for decentralized computing.
* **Global Data Center Connectivity**: By orchestrating data centers globally, Swan Chain accesses an expansive pool of computational resources, ensuring utmost availability and redundancy for its services.
* **Zero-Knowledge (ZK) Proofs**: Emphasizing security and privacy, Swan Chain adopts ZK proofs for the benchmarking of computing providers and facilitating privacy-preserving transactions within its ecosystem.

#### Financial Innovations and ZK Market Development

Swan Chain significantly enhances AI computing payment systems through smart contract implementation, notably reducing fees for micro-payments as a Layer 2 solution and ensuring efficient computing task validation. Moreover, Swan Chain pioneers the development of a ZK computing market, bolstering the AI ecosystem with a robust framework for computing benchmarking and validation. This ZK market not only supports the AI computing demands but also underpins the UBI model by providing a sustainable income source for computing providers.

#### Vision and Future Outlook

Swan Chain is steadfast in its mission to redefine the development, deployment, and scaling of AI and Web3 projects. By offering accessible, secure, and high-performance computing resources, coupled with innovative payment solutions and a ZK computing market, Swan Chain addresses the extant challenges faced by developers and businesses. The platform's dedication to a sustainable and equitable ecosystem, highlighted by its UBI model, paves the way for how decentralized networks can prioritize community welfare and participation.
