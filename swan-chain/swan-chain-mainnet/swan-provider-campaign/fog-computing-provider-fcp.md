# Fog Computing Provider (FCP)

**Fog Computing Providers (FCPs)** extend cloud capabilities to the edge of the network, providing scalable and distributed computing services. They play a crucial role in handling AI model training and deployment, leveraging infrastructure like Kubernetes (K8S).

### **Duration:**&#x20;

July 15 00:00 - September 15 23:59 (EST)

### **FCP Requirements:**

* Public IP
* Domain name (\*.example.com)
* SSL certificate
* At least one GPU
* Minimum 8 vCPUs
* Minimum 100GB SSD storage
* Minimum 64GB memory
* Minimum 50MB bandwidth

### **How to participate**

* Participants will be required to deploy a FCP following the [documentation](../../../swan-provider/computing-provider-cp/fog-computing-provider-fcp/computing-provider-setup.md) and [FCP Token Operations Guide](../../../swan-provider/computing-provider-cp/fog-computing-provider-fcp/fcp-token-operations-guide.md).
* The longer their GPUs and CPUs are utilized, and the higher their uptime, the more credits they'll earn.
* **Boost:** Using high-density GPUs such as Nvidia H100s, A100s, or top consumer models can yield a substantial 3-10x acceleration in reward calculations.
* **High-density GPU Boost Details:**
  * RTX 4090: 3X
  * H100: 5X
  * A100: 4X
  * A800: 3X
  * A4000: 4X
  * A10: 4X
  * A6000: 4X
  * H800: 6X
  * L40: 7X
  * L40S: 8X
  * H200: 10X
