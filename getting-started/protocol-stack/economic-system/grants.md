### **SWAN Job Incentive Grant: Matching Mechanism**

#### **Objective**:

To encourage job creators to place more jobs on the SWAN platform by providing a matching incentive, thereby enhancing the overall vibrancy and sustainability of the SWAN ecosystem.

#### **Mechanism**:

**1. Matching Percentage:**

* For every job placed by a creator, SWAN will match a predetermined percentage of the job's cost.
* This percentage acts as a direct incentive, providing additional value to the job creator's investment.

**2. Cap on Matching:**

* While the matching percentage provides added value, there's a ceiling to ensure fairness and sustainability.
* Regardless of the job's cost, the maximum matching amount by SWAN is limited to 100 Tokens.

**3. Example:**

* For a job costing 500 Tokens:
  * At a 10% match: SWAN contributes 50 Tokens.
  * At a 50% match: SWAN contributes 250 Tokens.
  * If the match exceeds 100 Tokens, only 100 Tokens are contributed due to the cap.

**4. Periodic Review:**

* The system isn't static. Both the matching percentage and the cap are subject to periodic reviews.
* Factors influencing reviews include available funds, job placement rate, and the overall health of the SWAN ecosystem.
* Adjustments ensure the program remains beneficial and sustainable.

**5. Eligibility Criteria:**

* To maintain the quality and integrity of the system, not all jobs or creators automatically qualify for matching.
* Criteria can encompass:
  * Quality and relevance of jobs.
  * The creator's history and reputation.
  * Alignment with SWAN's overarching objectives.
