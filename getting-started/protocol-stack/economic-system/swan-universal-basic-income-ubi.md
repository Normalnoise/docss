# Universal Basic Income (UBI)

The Universal Basic Income (UBI) model within the Swan Chain ecosystem represents a groundbreaking approach to ensuring equitable compensation for participants contributing computational resources. This model is designed to provide a basic level of income to all eligible computing providers within the network, thereby fostering a more inclusive and sustainable community. Here's a summary of the key aspects of Swan Chain's UBI model:

#### 2. Purpose and Vision

* **Inclusivity and Fair Compensation**: The UBI model is motivated by the desire to create a fair and equitable ecosystem where contributors are guaranteed a baseline compensation for their participation, irrespective of the fluctuating demand for computing tasks.
* **Encouraging Participation**: By assuring a basic income, Swan Chain aims to encourage more individuals and organizations to contribute their computing resources to the network, enhancing the ecosystem's computational capacity and diversity.
