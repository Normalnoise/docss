# Decentralized AI Computing Marketplace

The Decentralized AI Computing Marketplace is an innovative system designed to enable efficient and secure interactions between users and providers in a decentralized environment. This system utilizes smart contracts, a bidding engine, and decentralized storage to create a transparent and efficient marketplace for various tasks.

Providers in the system contribute their resources, such as storage, network bandwidth, CPU, and GPU, to offer services to users who publish tasks on the platform. These tasks are stored on decentralized storage like IPFS/Filecoin, ensuring data security and transparency.

The bidding engine manages a competitive bidding process, where providers with different resource capabilities bid on tasks. Smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain govern the bidding rules, enforce fair competition, and ensure the security of transactions.

Upon completion of a task by the selected provider, the final results are uploaded to the decentralized storage, maintaining data integrity and tamper-proofing. The smart contract then facilitates the automatic transfer of rewards from the task publisher to the provider as compensation for their services.

In summary, the Decentralized Auction Marketplace offers a secure and efficient platform for users to outsource tasks to a global network of providers with various resources. By leveraging blockchain technology, smart contracts, and decentralized storage, the system ensures transparency, security, and fairness in the bidding process and the execution of tasks.

### Key concepts

**Bidder (Provider)**: A bidder, also known as a provider, is a participant in the marketplace who offers their services to complete tasks. These services may include storage, network bandwidth, CPU, and GPU resources. Bidders are typically composed of blockchain nodes worldwide, and they actively participate in the competitive bidding process to secure tasks. Once assigned a task, bidders work to complete it to the best of their abilities, and the one with the best performance is rewarded by the task publisher.

**Publisher (User)**: A publisher, also known as a user, is an individual or organization that creates tasks in the marketplace. Publishers are responsible for defining the tasks, providing necessary details, and setting the rewards. They rely on the Decentralized Auction Marketplace to find suitable providers (bidders) to complete their tasks. Once the bidding process is complete and a provider has successfully delivered the task, the publisher rewards the provider through the smart contract system.

**Decentralized Storage**: Decentralized storage systems like IPFS/Filecoin are used to store tasks and their associated data. This ensures that the data remains secure, transparent, and tamper-proof, while also allowing for easy access by authorized parties.

**Bidding Engine**: The bidding engine manages the competitive bidding process, where providers bid on tasks based on their resource capabilities and offered prices. This component ensures that tasks are allocated to providers in a fair and efficient manner.

**Smart Contracts**: Smart contracts are self-executing contracts on the EVM blockchain that govern the bidding rules, enforce fair competition, and ensure the security of transactions. They facilitate the automatic transfer of rewards from users to providers upon task completion and manage other aspects of the bidding process.
