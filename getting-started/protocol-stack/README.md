Multichain computing protocol(MCP) is an open-sourced standard for developers to easily build secure multi-chain services and applications. With a universal bridging interface, developers can utilize resources across multiple blockchain networks including computing, storage, and bandwidth, eliminating the need for developers to write agile code for fast cross-chain integrations. MCP opens a new category of web3 applications that can be built by developers for multi-chain ecosystems.

**Protocol Requirements**

In order to enable a new class of web3 native dApps, a Decentralized Query Protocol must meet the following requirements:

1. Web3 Resource Discovery:  client should be able to get the web3 resources with minimum effort on the network
2. Data availability: a client should be able to pay to keep the data available for running queries against specific data sources.&#x20;
3. Price efficiency: clients should be able to pay for data, bandwidth, and computing resource availability in efficient and competitive marketplaces.&#x20;
4. Incentive alignment—incentives should be aligned between clients, providers, and dApp de- velopers to encourage growth of the network and positive network effects.&#x20;

## Protocol Layers

1. [Consensus Layer](cross-chain-contracts.md)—responsible for smart contract execution and payment settlement.
2. &#x20;[Peer-to-peer (P2P) Network](peer-to-peer-p2p-network.md)—defines how nodes locate and connect.
3. &#x20;[Payment Channels](payment-channels.md) —facilitates fast and low-cost payments in the system.
4. [Service Discovery](service-discovery.md)  – Server nodes and reputation module for public service
5. &#x20;[Data Marketplace ](data-marketplace.md)— the mechanism by which users pay nodes for the dataset.
6. [Decentralized AI Computing Marketplace](decentralized-ai-computing-marketplace/) — globe AI computing task market
7. [ZK Proof Marketplace](indexing-and-caching-marketplace.md)— globe zk computing task market
8. [Storage Layer](storage-layer.md) — data stored on public blockchains or content addressable networks.
9. [Computing Layer ](computing-layer.md)— how a query is routed to a specific node for computing.
10. [CDN Layer ](cdn-layer.md)– how data is distributed and hosted on the global network
11. [Governance](token/governance/) —manages schemas, treasure, and disputes.
