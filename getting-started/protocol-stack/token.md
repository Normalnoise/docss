# Token

## Overview

The Swan Token within the SwanChain ecosystem appears  serve multiple utilities, enhancing the functionality and governance of the platform. From the provided diagram, here's a breakdown of the Swan Token's utilities:

#### Payment and Incentive Mechanism

* **Marketplace Transactions**: Users can purchase SwanChain products and services using Swan Tokens, making it the primary medium of exchange within the marketplace.
* **Compute Resource Provision**: Compute providers stake Swan Tokens to offer their computational resources to the network. In return, they receive rewards in Swan Tokens for the compute power they provide, creating a cyclical incentive structure.

#### Auction Participation

* **Auction Engine Engagement**: Validators in the auction engine stake Swan Tokens to participate in auction automation, ensuring the proper functioning of the marketplace's bidding and resource allocation processes.

#### Network Governance

* **DAO Participation**: Stakers of the Swan Token have governance rights in the SwanChain DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization), allowing them to vote on proposals and decisions that steer the project's development and operations.
* **Treasury Management**: The SwanChain DAO controls the treasury, which collects fees from the ecosystem's operations. A portion of these collected fees can be used for various purposes, including burning tokens to reduce supply, thereby potentially increasing value, and buybacks.

#### Fee Distribution and Tokenomics

* **Fee Collection**: A portion of the transaction fees collected within the platform is distributed back into the ecosystem. For instance, 75% of fees collected could be directed to the treasury, while 25% could be used for token buybacks or other deflationary mechanisms.
* **Validator Penalties**: Validators who do not act in the network's best interest can be slashed, meaning a portion of their staked Swan Tokens may be burned as a penalty for malicious actions or failures.

Total Supply: 1,000,000,000 Tokens.
